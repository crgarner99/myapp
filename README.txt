What else can you do with Node Packages?
You can do a variety of things from creating your own server and website, to just a backend server to test with.

 What else can you do with Express? 
 YOu can create websites, and mobile apps, and probably a lot more that im not sure of.

 What other technologies could you use instead of Express?
 You can use React, Koa, FastAPI, and a lot more.

 How is hosting in Express different than how you've hosted before?
 Ive never hosted before so I cant say its different other than you can host locally from your computer.
